# twrp_device_motorola_ali

Device tree for building TWRP for the Moto G6 (ALI):
Files have been modified from TWRPBuilder script and device tree from ADDISON---then modified much much more.

Decryption is currently in testing phase.  It works with OPSS27.104-15-10 for sure.
 -If you want to test, please make whatever backups you think you'll want before hand.


This should build using minimal TWRP manifest.
